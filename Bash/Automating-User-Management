#Bash script that will add a new user on multiple remote servers using SSH. It will prompt for the username, password, and a list of target servers.

# Features:
# Accepts user input for the new username and password.
# Loops through a list of servers and adds the user on each.
# Sets a default password and forces the user to change it on first login.
# Adds the user to a specified group (optional).
# Ensures the script runs only if executed with root privileges.
# Script: add_user_multi_servers.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure the script is run as root
if [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then
    echo "This script must be run as root!" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Prompt for new username
read -p "Enter new username: " NEW_USER

# Prompt for default password (hidden input)
read -s -p "Enter default password: " PASSWORD

# List of target servers (modify as needed)
SERVERS=(
    "server1.example.com"
    "server2.example.com"
    "server3.example.com"

# Optional: specify a group to add the user to
